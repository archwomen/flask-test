# Community Standards

Arch Women contains a diverse group of people who have come together to lower
the barriers for women to contribute to Arch Linux and FOSS as well as make
friends and have fun. Our community standards are a set of guidelines for
members to follow when they interact with each other.

Our online community includes the main archwomen.org website, social media
groups, and our IRC channels. We expect community members to be helpful and
respectful. Treat others how you would like to be treated and take
responsibility for your words and actions. Spamming, trolling, harassment,
bullying, discrimination and threatening behavior will not be tolerated.
